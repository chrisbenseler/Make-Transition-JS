{"name":"Make-transition-js","tagline":"Make list elements transitions","body":"Make Transition JS\r\n==================\r\nJavascript component to make transitions from li elements\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n============\r\nThe component adds and removes a css class (default name: sliding) to the li's child from a list element. Then, with CSS, it is possible to hide and show the elements or even better: use CSS 3 tranform and transition properties to a better user experience. Check the example/ directory\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n- include maketransition.css and maketransition.min.js from dist/ folder to your project\r\n- instantiate the MakeSlider object passing an ul element as element\r\n<code>\r\nvar slider = new MakeTransition({\r\n\telement : document.getElementById(\"maketransition-list\")\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n- transitions may be changed in css\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n======\r\n- requires jQuery\r\n- CSS is required to show, hide, make transitions, whatever to the elements. Make Transition JS just handle the class property in the DOM\r\n- li elements must have css absolute positioning\r\n- tested (still) only in Firefox and Chrome with jQuery 1.8.2","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
