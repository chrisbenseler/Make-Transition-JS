Make Transition JS
==================

Javascript component to make transitions from <li> elements

How it works
============
The component adds and removes a css class (default name: sliding) to the <li>s child from a list element. Then, with CSS, it is possible to hide and show the elements or even better: use CSS 3 tranform and transition properties to a better user experience. Check the example/ directory

Usage

Notes
======
- requires jQuery
- CSS is required to show, hide, make transitions, whatever to the elements. Make Transition JS just handle the class property in the DOM
- <li> elements must have css absolute positioning
- tested (still) only in Firefox and Chrome with jQuery 1.8.2
